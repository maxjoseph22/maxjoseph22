## 👋 Hi there, I'm Max! 👋

I'm a Software Engineer living in London with a unique combination of technical skills and established financial experience. I recently completed an intensive Full Stack Development Bootcamp at Makers, where I developed my knowledge in JavaScript, Python, React.js, Node.js, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, HTML, and CSS. 

I'm currently building a web-application for a popular content-creator on Instagram with over 7 million followers. For 12 years they have been taking photos and videos of all the different dogs in New York city and have uploaded nearly 10,000 posts garnering millions of likes. This considerable amount of data was being severely under-leveraged by Instagram's lack of native search and sorting capabilities. If a user wanted to find a dog with a specific name or of a certain breed, they were limited to having to scroll through every post until they got lucky (or got bored and gave up!). There were a number of questions that both the content-creator and their followers wanted to know the answers to: which were the most popular breeds and names? Which breeds had never been featured? Which dogs had the most likes? The list went on. All of these were unanswerable without an organised database and bespoke application, which is where I came in.


I was tasked with analysing string data from their Instagram post captions with a goal of extracting meaningful data to then be organised and stored in SQL tables. If done successfully, it would then be possible to search self   data fields  with a Python backend, Flask web-app framework and a Psycopg SQL database adapter. I've split the app into two repositories. InstaOrganise, which was my first iteration of the project, contains the logic for one of the key hurdles I had to overcome - how to extract meaningful data from thousands of unique and unstructured Instagram captions.
